# 📊 Data Analytics Project

## 🧩 Overview

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end data analytics workflow** — from data loading and cleaning to analysis, visualization, and reporting.
It showcases the use of **Python, SQL (MSSQL, Oracle SQL, MySQL)**, and **Power BI** to extract insights and present them through an interactive dashboard and professional report.

Would you like me to tailor this README for **a specific dataset** (like sales, HR, finance, or healthcare)?
That helps me add more realistic examples and metrics to impress recruiters.
